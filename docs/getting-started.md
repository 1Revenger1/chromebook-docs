## Getting Started
Before we begin, we need to go over a few things.

-------------

### Supported Devices:

Please refer to [this chart](supported-devices.html) for a full list of supported devices.

-------------

### Prerequisites
* Know your hardware 
  * Your CPU model and generation
  * Your iGPU
  * Your storage devices (HDD/SSD, eMMC, NVMe, etc.)
  * **Your boardname**
  * If you don't know where to find this info, take a look at the [System Info Page.](system-info.html)
*  **A basic knowledge of command lines and how to use a terminal/command prompt.**
  * We can't help you if you don't know how to cd to a directory or delete a file.
* A minimum of an 8GB USB drive or SD Card for creating a bootable OS installer.

------

### Asking for help properly:
If you are facing a issue, please read the [FAQ](faq.html) first.

{: .important } 
> When asking for help, ask in English. We can't help you if we don't understand the question. Using a translator is fine.

**Do not use manufacturer's model name or serial number when asking for help** (i.e: HP Chromebook 14a), it doesn't help with identifying the machine. Provide the boardname, otherwise your support request will be ignored. If you don't know where to find your boardname, take a look [here.](system-info.html)


### Provide logs.

* If you're experiencing firmware bugs, provide output from `cbmem` console.
* If you're experiencing issues with Linux, provide output from `dmesg`, `dmidecode` and `journalctl` or `/var/log/messages`, respectively
* Ift you're experiencing issues with Windows, provide screenshots from Device Manager, Event Viewer, coredumps etc.
* If you're experiencing issues with macOS, please ask for help in the Chrultrabook Discord, in the #hackintosh channel. 

See the [Debugging Page](debugging.html) for instructions on how to get these logs.

--------------

With that out the way, let's move on to the fun stuff:
