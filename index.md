### What is a chrultrabook and who is this guide for?

A chrultrabook is a modified Chromebook that is able to run Windows, Linux, or even macOS by using MrChromebox's coreboot firmware. The purpose of this site is to provide documentation that is detailed, user-friendly, and has up to date information about the hardware, software, and firmware on Chromebooks

--------------------------------------

**The docs focuses on two main things:**

*   Installing an altOS on your Chromebook.
*   Learning in-depth information about your Chromebook.

Because of this, you **are** expected to read, learn, and use Google. This is not a one click procedure.

--------------------------------------

Finally, those who are still facing issues can ask for help in the [chrultrabook Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tkPTk5w).

Help us improve this documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/chrultrabook/docs/)!
